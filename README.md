# Loan-Deafult-Prediction
Use of Deep Neural Networks to predict whether a borrower is going to default on loan or not.
Banks earn a major part of their revenue by lending loans. But, with lending comes a great financial risk due to the possibility of borrower defaulting on loan. The traditional methods of mitigating this issue involved setting up a panel of experts who would analyze the data concerning applicantâ€™s employment records, annual income, interest rate, credit history, etc. However, with the increase in computational power and the recent advancements in machine learning, it has been a topic of interest whether ML algorithms can perform better classification. Our aim is to analyze a dataset pertaining to loan borrowers in the past and build a strong ML model to classify if any borrower is likely to default or not.

### Results

After data-preprocessing, feature-selection, and hyper-parametertuning, the final model resulted in the following results:

* The cross-validation set was used for hyperparameter 
tuning and continuously tracking the performance of the 
network on unseen data. The cross-validation accuracy 
was found to be 89.04% whereas the F1-score was 
found to be 0.75 for the positive defaulter class which is 
very important since predicting a defaulter as a nondefaulter (Type2 error) is a greater risk for the bank 
than missed loan (Type1 error).

* The accuracy over test-set was found to be 89.22%. The 
model yielded satisfactory results over both seen and 
unseen data.
